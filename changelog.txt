-----------

- Custom Trakt lists are tagged by their name

v0.2
- Uses JSON to write the tags so now it's much more portable. 
- Should work for people using MySQL just fine. 
- MUCH better progress updates, logging and error checking. 
- Writes tags instead of playlists - much more flexible
- Preserves existing tags and only writes as needed
- New feature - much slower! That's just how JSON rolls I'm afraid. 
- Background music (to comfort you while you wait)
- Uses the xbmc "label" to make a match (no more folder name dependence)
- Option to wipe all your tags if you want to start from scratch
